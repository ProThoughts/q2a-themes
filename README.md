Question2Answer themes
=================================================

This repository contains all public themes I create. Most are licensed under GPLv3.

The `Advanced-Mods` folder contains snippets of code modifying the layout/content of a theme that I hope will be useful.

SV-Clean-Base
-------------------------------------------------

A basic theme with some usability modifications:

- Cleaner, neutral colours to make everything easier to read.
- Unique titles on paginated sections such as the lists of questions, users and tags.
- Adding `[closed]` to question titles (on question list and view pages).
- Larger voting buttons, positioned above and below the vote count.
- Better images for voting, favourite and best answer buttons (including CSS sprite improvements for speed).
- No voting on question lists (where the full question is not visisble).
- Views listed under question/answer count.
- Neater form layout.
- Remove useless meta keywords tag.
